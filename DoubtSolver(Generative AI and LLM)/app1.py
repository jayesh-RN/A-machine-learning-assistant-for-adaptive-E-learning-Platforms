    \n4. Save Consistently:\n\nSet up automatic transfers to a dedicated savings account for your down payment and closing costs.\nConsider using a high-yield savings account to maximize interest earned.
    \n5. Reduce Debt:\n\nPay off any outstanding debts, such as credit card balances, to reduce financial obligations and improve your credit score.
    \n6. Explore Government Assistance Programs:\n\nResearch government programs that provide financial assistance for first-time homebuyers, such as down payment assistance or closing cost grants.
    \n7. Get Pre-Approved for a Mortgage:\n\nObtain a mortgage pre-approval to determine your borrowing capacity and strengthen your position when making an offer on a home.
    \nConclusion:\n\nAchieving homeownership with a monthly salary of INR {:.0f} and monthly expenses of INR {:.0f} requires careful financial planning and discipline. By following these steps, you can save consistently, reduce debt, and position yourself to purchase a home worth INR {:.0f} in three years."""
